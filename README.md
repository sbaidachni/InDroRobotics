# How Azure Services Taught Drones to Rescue People #

In this joint development effort, Microsoft teamed up with InDro Robotics to create a solution that can analyze lots of incoming data from drones in order to recognize crashes, wrecks and accidents automatically.

We used several Azure services to achieve our goal.  These services include:
 - Azure IoT Hub
 - Azure Blobs
 - Azure Functions
 - Azure Mobile Applications
 - Azure SQL 
 - Xamarin (Xamarin.Forms) - utilized to create universal cross-platform applications
